    "The basic idea behind most rockets is Newton's second law, which shows that force is the rate of momentum change. Now consider a rocket which is composed of fuel and payload, to have a simple model, we consider the case in vacuum no gravity environment.\n",

    "\n",
    "What is the second term? It is the effective force produced by propellant, thus the velocity is actually the exhaust velocity of the propellant in center of mass frame, in other words, the relative velocity between the rocket and the propellant."
